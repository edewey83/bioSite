            <p>Paul is very passionate about Jurassic Park and all things Jurassic park. It started when has a pre-teen he watched the original move. It sacred him so bad he didnâ€™t sleep for days. It eventually sprung up as his biggest interest. He has over 100 different dinosaur figures with the majority of them being stashed in seven 55 gallon tubs in storage. At his work he has dinosaur pictures, stickers, figures and more decorating his desk. The last time we visited he had them all over the apartment. I remember seeing some pretty cool ones!!!</p>
