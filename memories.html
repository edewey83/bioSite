        <h2>Papa New Guinea</h2>
        <article>
            <ul>
                <li>Driving along the cliffs in a little yellow jeep. He remembers hating this, and wishing to be elsewhere.</li>
                <li>The Seven beautiful waterfalls along the cliffs.</li>
                <li>Jumping off the radio tower, because as he stated “That’s what Mary Poppins had done.”</li>
                <li>Being able to only use the radio every few days to contact whomever.</li>
                <li>Playing with the village children and being bit by a pig. They carried him back to his mom as if he had died, and they were in funeral procession. He remembers his mom being so scared she about shit her pants, then being angry they scared her so bad.</li>
                <li>Escaping the “Long, Long Man”, a villager who had threatened them many times. The authorities believed the man was capable of doing things with witchcraft/Blackmagic and were scared of him, thus unwilling to help. Eventually they left after the man broke into their house when Paul’s father was away helping some villagers in the brush. He remembers being super scared, and grateful that the man was unable to get to them as they hid until he finally went away. Such a traumatic memory for such a young child!</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Russia</h1>
        <article>
            <ul>
                <li>He remembers going to Russia for the first time in 1994. Three years after the fall of the USSR. This was a scary time to be an American in Russia. Everything was so horrible that he had a small breakdown. They were in the worst parts of a city he had ever seen. Everything was broken, and there were giant silo’s of a power plant, just a mile or two away. It had only been a few years since Chernobyl had happened.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote class="one">“I was terrified… wondering what I had gotten myself into… if I would even make it home, and then I met the people.”
    He remembers going to the beach on the Amur river with Sergei and his family, Nina and Maria (He had an ENORMOUS crush on Maria...so much that he actually gave her his Game Boy when I left). We went out there for a day, took a ferry over to their dacha (which is basically a tiny garden with a shed), and then sat on the beach grilling all day...first time he had ever tried rabbit

            <ul>
                <li>He also remembers going to a village called Cinda fondly, when I asked him about this he said.</li></ul>
            <blockquote class="one">“We stayed with a family of fishermen, and helped them work through the day. In the morning we chopped wood for the fire. In the afternoon we went out in boats and fished the Amur river with nets. In the evening we came home and ate one of the fish we had caught, in that particular case...a carp. They literally just threw the entire fish in a pot and cooked it. I mean the ENTIRE fish...head...insides...it was not pleasant...but after a day chopping wood and fishing with nets, it wasn't the worst thing.”
